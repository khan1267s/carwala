# TED Talk Clip Generator - Changelog

## Version 2.0.0 - Video Clipping Fixes (2025-01-28)

### ðŸŽ¯ **Major Video Processing Improvements**

#### âœ… **Fixed Video Duration Detection**
- **Issue**: Video duration detection was unreliable and could fail when stream metadata was missing
- **Fix**: Improved `get_video_info()` function to:
  - Try format duration first (more reliable)
  - Fallback to stream duration if format is unavailable  
  - Add proper error handling for FFprobe failures
  - Validate return codes before processing output

#### âœ… **Enhanced FFmpeg Command Structure**
- **Issue**: Audio/video filters could conflict, causing processing failures
- **Fix**: Completely restructured FFmpeg command generation:
  - Separate video and audio filter chains to prevent conflicts
  - Improved silence removal with bidirectional processing
  - Added smart cropping that preserves aspect ratio
  - Enhanced quality settings with CRF and bitrate control
  - Added `+faststart` flag for better web playback

#### âœ… **Improved Audience Detection Algorithm**
- **Issue**: Audience detection was too simplistic and prone to false positives
- **Fix**: Implemented sophisticated computer vision pipeline:
  - Better face detection parameters with minimum size filtering
  - Face size analysis to distinguish audience (small faces) from speakers (large faces)
  - Temporal smoothing to reduce false positives
  - Minimum segment duration filtering (3+ seconds)
  - Consensus-based detection using surrounding frame analysis

#### âœ… **Fixed Clip Overlap Calculation**
- **Issue**: Poor overlap handling caused gaps in coverage or missed content
- **Fix**: Intelligent advancement algorithm:
  - Proper overlap validation to ensure no gaps
  - Different advancement strategies for audience vs. speaker content
  - Configurable speaker time percentage enforcement
  - Smaller incremental steps when skipping audience segments

#### âœ… **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Issue**: Processing could fail silently or with unclear error messages
- **Fix**: Comprehensive error handling system:
  - File validation before processing (existence, size, readability)
  - Video duration validation against clip settings
  - FFmpeg timeout protection (5-minute limit per clip)
  - Output file validation (size, existence)
  - Automatic cleanup of failed/partial files
  - Detailed error reporting with actionable messages

#### âœ… **OpenCV Compatibility**
- **Issue**: Haarcascade classifiers could fail to load on different OpenCV versions
- **Fix**: Multi-version compatibility:
  - Try modern `cv2.data.haarcascades` path first
  - Fallback to system path `/usr/share/opencv4/haarcascades/`
  - Graceful degradation when classifiers unavailable
  - Added `opencv-data` package dependency for system installations

#### âœ… **Dependency Validation**
- **Issue**: Application could start without required tools
- **Fix**: Startup dependency checking:
  - Validate FFmpeg and FFprobe availability
  - Version checking with clear error messages
  - Helpful installation instructions on failure
  - Prevents runtime failures due to missing tools

### ðŸš€ **Performance Optimizations**

- **Video Processing**: Optimized frame sampling rate for audience detection
- **Memory Usage**: Improved cleanup of temporary files and resources
- **Error Recovery**: Faster failure detection with immediate cleanup
- **Command Generation**: More efficient filter chain construction

### ðŸ›  **Technical Improvements**

- **Smart Cropping**: Only crops when video is wider than 16:9 aspect ratio
- **Audio Processing**: Bidirectional silence removal for better results
- **Progress Tracking**: More accurate progress reporting during processing
- **File Validation**: Pre-flight checks prevent processing corrupt files

### ðŸ“‹ **Validation & Testing**

- Added comprehensive test suite covering all major functions
- Automated validation of video info extraction
- Audience detection algorithm testing
- Clip generation and file integrity verification
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

### ðŸ”§ **System Requirements Updates**

- **Required**: FFmpeg 4.0+ (with h.264 and AAC support)
- **Required**: OpenCV 4.0+ with haarcascade data
- **Recommended**: At least 4GB RAM for processing
- **Recommended**: SSD storage for better performance

## How to Update

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3-flask python3-flask-cors python3-opencv python3-numpy ffmpeg opencv-data
   ```

2. **Update Application**:
   - Replace `app.py` with the new version
   - No database migrations required
   - Existing settings remain compatible

3. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   # Should show: "âœ“ All dependencies available"
   ```

## Breaking Changes

- **None** - All existing functionality remains compatible
- Settings and API endpoints unchanged
- Existing clips/projects not affected

## Bug Reports

If you encounter issues after updating:

1. Check FFmpeg version: `ffmpeg -version`
2. Verify OpenCV data: `ls /usr/share/opencv4/haarcascades/`
3. Test with a small video file first
4. Check application logs for detailed error messages
